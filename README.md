## The Basic Idea

This is a repo containing many resources I've collected through other projects, to serve as a personal reference.

## Features

- Makefile and install scripts (local computer setup)
- Ansible (server configuration and infrastructure as code)
- Unify Controller on a Raspberry Pi with Docker and Systemd
