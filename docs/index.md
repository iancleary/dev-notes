## The Basic Idea

This is a repo containing many resources I've collected through other projects, to serve as a personal reference.

## Features

- local computer setup scripts with a self-documenting Makefile
- ansible (server configuration and infrastructure as code)
- Raspberry Pi Configuration for a UniFi Wireless Access Point Controller with Docker and systemd
